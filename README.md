The City of Liberty: Constructed Truth, Controlled
 Power, and the Player’s Dilemma
 Younseong John Jeong
 May 2025
 Introduction
 In the realm of storytelling, few forces are as potent or as perilous as knowledge. From Jorge Luis
 Borges’ infinite library to the haunting symbolism in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Birthmark,”
 literature has long grappled with the dual role of knowledge as both a liberator and a tyrant. My
 game, TheCityofLiberty, is a dark fantasy narrative grounded in these tensions, where power is not
 enforced through brute strength alone, but through the manipulation of what is known, believed,
 and remembered. Drawing on philosophical texts by Friedrich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault,
 as well as historical analyses of inquisitions by Parker and Starr-LeBeau, this project reflects on
 how societies construct “truth” to maintain order, and how individuals confront, resist, or reinforce
 these constructions.
 At the center of this game is a fractured world once united by a lie: the Rune of Order, a fabricated
 miracle that justified a hierarchy of control created by the first lord of order. Now, years after its
 mythic discovery, the world is governed by demigods: past heroes who overthrew the first order
 but now divided by ideology, and factions whose conflicting worldviews reflect deeper philosoph
1
ical battles. From the Church and the Inquisitioners who uphold sacred order, to the Heretics and
 Book Burners who challenge it, to the Oni Cult and the enigmatic Vella Laikar faction seeking
 new meaning in chaos, The City of Liberty invites players into a world where every truth is con
tested. This essay explores the intellectual foundations of that world, reflecting on how the game’s
 structure, characters, and choices are shaped by classical literature and scholarly theory.
 Philosophy and Paradox: Nietzsche, Borges, and Hamlet
 Atits core, The City of Liberty is a meditation on the conflict between constructed order and chaotic
 truth, a theme deeply rooted in Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy. Nietzsche argues that the most
 profound works of art arise from a tension between the Apollonian (reason, clarity, structure) and
 the Dionysian (ecstasy, emotion, destruction). This duality is embodied in the game’s 5 demigods:
 former heroes who once brought balance but have since fractured into competing ideologies. One
 rules through strict order and enforced ritual; another embraces chaos and seeks to rewrite the
 world’s runes entirely. The player, caught between these poles, must choose whether to perpetuate
 balance, challenge it, or collapse it entirely.
 This existential uncertainty echoes the themes of Borges’ “The Library of Babel,” where infinite
 knowledge becomes indistinguishable from madness. The game’s ruins, filled with forgotten runes
 and contradictory texts, take direct inspiration from Borges’ vision of a limitless archive. In The
 City of Liberty, knowledge is no longer a tool of liberation it is a weapon, a curse, a religion.
 Different factions interpret the same fragments of truth differently, and players must learn that
 understanding is not the same as wisdom.
 Similarly, Hamlet haunts the protagonist’s journey. Like the Prince of Denmark, the player is
 pulled into a world where appearances deceive, loyalties fracture, and the search for truth leads
 only to more questions. Hamlet’s famous hesitation, his need for certainty before action, parallels
 the player’s own burden: how can one act decisively in a world built on lies? The game encourages
 2
reflection, even paralysis, before revelation. Players are not rewarded for knowledge alone, but for
 how they live with it.
 Ambition, Perfection, and Ruin: From Hawthorne to Bacon to
 Shelley
 The world of The City of Liberty was born from ambition, Not divine prophecy, but human will.
 Centuries before the game begins, the original Lord of Order claimed to have discovered the Rune
 of Order, a perfect symbol that could restore harmony to a fractured world. This discovery, how
ever, was a fabrication—an invention meant to stabilize chaos and unite the survivors of a ruinous
 war. Drawing from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Birthmark, the Lord’s attempt to impose perfection
 reflects a fatal flaw: the belief that purity and control are worth any sacrifice.
 That lie held for a time. But truth, like Frankenstein’s creature, eventually breaks free.
 Inspired by Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the game’s world now bears the scars of its creator’s
 failure. After uncovering the lie, five heroes, now revered as demigods, overthrew the false ruler.
 Yet instead of liberating the world, they divided it. The most powerful among them, now known
 as the Hierophant, founded the Church to impose rigid control through ritual and fear. But Vella
 Laikar, once one of the five, grew disillusioned. Her journey reflects the arc of Bacon’s New
 Atlantis, where knowledge becomes entangled with secrecy. Rather than reinforce the illusion,
 Vella began gathering followers in secret. In the game, this hidden faction can only be discovered
 through specific player actions, and their existence transforms the story.
 Thus, the City of Liberty, once a utopia of free knowledge, now lies splintered. The Church upholds
 sacred order. The Heretics and Book Burners fight dogma with fire. The Oni Cult embraces chaos
 as rebirth. And Vella Laikar waits in the shadows, preparing for a second rupture—one not of war,
 but of revelation.

Power, Belief, and the Player’s Dilemma: Foucault and the Ma
chinery of Truth
 In The City of Liberty, knowledge is not merely hidden it is produced. Michel Foucault’s theory of
 discourse offers a critical lens for understanding how power operates in the game’s world. Accord
ing to Foucault, truth is not an absolute, but a construct shaped by institutional frameworks. The
 Church, founded by the strongest demigod, exemplifies this machinery. It does not merely silence
 dissent it redefines what dissent means.
 This ideological enforcement is reinforced by historical precedent. In Judging Faith, Punishing
 Sin, Parker and Starr-LeBeau analyze how inquisitions shaped societies by defining sin and en
forcing conformity. Similarly, the Inquisitioners in the game are not zealots but bureaucrats of
 belief. Their power lies in shaping not just behavior, but identity.
 As the player moves through this landscape, they are constantly confronted by competing systems
 of meaning. Some factions offer comfort through tradition; others promise freedom through de
struction. Every choice the player makes: what knowledge to trust, which runes to translate, which
 faction to support, becomes a philosophical stance. The game does not reward blind loyalty or
 rebellion, but reflection.
 Conclusion: Building Meaning Through Code and Choice
 The City of Liberty is more than a narrative experiment. It is a playable philosophy. It asks players
 not simply to win, but to think. But this reflection is not limited to narrative alone, it is embedded
 in the game’s mechanics, built line by line in code.
 Players begin their journey as students enrolled in a university within the City of Liberty. Their
 major determines their initial affinity with different types of runes. As they attend lectures, explore
 the campus, and interact with professors and forbidden texts, they uncover contradictions in the
 4
system. This educational framing was deliberately chosen: learning, in this world, is political.
 The game’s Java implementation reflects this through a structured, stat-based system with a dy
namic GUI. Dialogue options, events, and outcomes shift based on the player’s knowledge level,
 rune affinity, and allegiances. Vella Laikar’s faction, for example, remains hidden unless the player
 pursues certain lines of inquiry—mirroring how truth is often discoverable only through disobedi
ence. The stats of the player including health and wisdom are hidden from the player creating a
 more realistic experience.
 This fusion of narrative theory and technical design reflects the central message of the project:
 systems shape understanding. In building this game, I have come to understand not just how
 stories are told, but how systems tell them. The City of Liberty is both an homage to the thinkers
 who shaped it and an invitation to players to shape it further through doubt, through discovery,
 and, ultimately, through choice. The current state of the game is still under development and I plan
 to create a more digital game based on this project in the near future. The github address with all
 the code is this: https://github.com/Krasvi/LIBERTY I will also upload images of how the game
 compiles in my computer. please note that some of the code is not used in the current working
 game but is to be used for future development. The game as it is now only ends when certain
 choices lead you to meet Vella Laikar.
