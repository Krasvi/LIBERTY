# LIBERTY: The City of Liberty

A narrative-driven, stat-based dark fantasy RPG built in Java.  
Set in a fractured society where knowledge is power—and often a lie.

---

## 🎮 Overview

**The City of Liberty** is a playable philosophy project that merges literature, game design, and code. Inspired by Borges, Nietzsche, Foucault, Hawthorne, and others, the game explores how societies construct truth to maintain control—and how individuals can choose to challenge, reinforce, or redefine it.

You begin as a student in the City of Liberty, a surface-level utopia built on a false narrative called the Rune of Order. As you attend lectures and explore the world, you uncover ideological tensions between powerful factions such as the Church, Heretics, Book Burners, Oni Cult, and a hidden faction led by the demigod Vella Laikar.

 Inspiration & Intellectual Framework
City of Liberty is more than just a fantasy game—it’s a system of thought. The project was inspired by a blend of literature, philosophy, and historical analysis that interrogate how truth is produced, controlled, and contested.

Core Literary & Philosophical Influences
Jorge Luis Borges – The Library of Babel
→ The game’s fragmented world reflects Borges’ vision of infinite, contradictory knowledge where meaning is both elusive and dangerous.

Friedrich Nietzsche – The Birth of Tragedy
→ The Apollonian (order) and Dionysian (chaos) duality shapes the conflict between factions and demigods. The player's decisions reflect this philosophical tension.

Michel Foucault – Power/Knowledge & Discipline and Punish
→ Truth is shown not as objective but institutional—produced through systems like the Church and enforced through the Inquisitioners.

Nathaniel Hawthorne – The Birthmark
→ The Lord of Order's attempt at perfection represents humanity's fatal flaw: the desire to overwrite nature for control, leading to unintended ruin.

Mary Shelley – Frankenstein
→ Knowledge, once created, cannot be unmade. The world still bears the scars of a lie—just as Frankenstein’s creature haunts its creator.

Francis Bacon – The New Atlantis
→ Vella Laikar’s hidden society parallels Bacon’s utopia of controlled discovery—where secrets are kept not for greed, but survival.

William Shakespeare – Hamlet
→ The player, like Hamlet, is paralyzed by too much knowledge. Doubt becomes central to the narrative, and truth never comes without cost.

Parker & Starr-LeBeau – Judging Faith, Punishing Sin
→ The Inquisitioners mirror early modern inquisitions: less about zealotry, more about shaping what people can think and can be.

Design Philosophy
Learning is political in this world.

Runes are not just magic—they are metaphors for control.

The GUI interface is not just visual—it is the player’s window into contradiction.

Players are rewarded not for power, but for reflection. Every choice, alliance, and text read in-game becomes a philosophical stance.
